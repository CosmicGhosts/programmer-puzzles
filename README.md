Mordor Challenge
================

Welcome to the gates of Mordor, should you be granted entry you wil be one step closer
to joining one of the most exciting development teams in Las Vegas.  There are two 
challenges that guard this gate and you must solve them both to be granted entry.

Challenge #1: Fizz Buzz
------------------------
This is an old one but a good one with a little twist.  That twist is that your solution
must be coded in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell).  We want to know
your understanding of Functional Programming as we use JavaScript extensively and utilizing
FP paradigms in JavaScript is often the correct solution. 

### The Challenge
You will write a script that reads 3 command line arguments:
1. first divisor
2. second divisor
3. upper bound
